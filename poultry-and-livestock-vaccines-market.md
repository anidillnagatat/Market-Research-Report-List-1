<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Poultry and Livestock Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Live Vaccine</li><li>Inactivated vaccine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The poultry and livestock vaccines market consists of two main types: live vaccines and inactivated vaccines. Live vaccines contain attenuated or weaker forms of pathogens that stimulate a strong immune response, offering long-lasting protection. Inactivated vaccines, on the other hand, use killed pathogens, which helps to provoke an immune response without the risk of disease transmission. Both vaccine types play a crucial role in enhancing animal health, preventing disease outbreaks, and ensuring food safety in the livestock and poultry industries.</p></p>
